Here is a list of common errors that may occur with the code

Syntax error: This means you most likely typed in a Variable like X or Y, or you may have typed a word (which this calculator CANNOT do)

Missing files: This means that the script was not installed properly and you may have to reinstall it.

(These are all of the currently known bugs)
